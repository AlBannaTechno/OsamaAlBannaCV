  * Notes
    * This application demnostrate the main design paradigm php oriented to , which called/ImplementedAs `Spaghetti Pattern`
      * This Pattern considered as an `anti-pattern` , so it's very dangerous to use it in medium+ application
      But since it is the most commom paradigm php designed for 
      `for example you can use many globals/statac variable at any place` which violate SRP `Single Responsibility Principle`
    * So, Why Create This app with this pattern ?
      * Answer : to demonstrate some of use cases of this pattern , and show how very easy this pattern may destroy any project
     with just simple refactoring
     
     * At the end , there is no way in php to implement things like Clean Architecture without top-level abstraction layers
     eg, frameworks `eg, laravel` to restrict some of the language features or produce an alternatives of anti-pattern core features ,`but surely this will comes with performance costs`
